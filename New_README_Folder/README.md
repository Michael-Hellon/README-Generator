  # Professional README Generator

  ## Description
  This project will build the user a Professional README.md file. The user will be asked several questions and will select a license from a list to use for the project.
  - My motivation was to create a JavaScript program that used libraries to easily build a professional quality README.md file.
  - I built this project to help save time creating a professional quality README.
  - This project solved the problem of spending lots of time building and formatting a new README file for each project.
  - I learned several things from doing this challenge. One, how easy it is to use a module like inquirer.js for command line user interface. Two, I originally wrote this program all in one file and then, based off the assignment requirements, I split it up into the index.js and generateMarkdown.js files. Splitting the original code up and putting it where it belonged was the easy part. By doing so, I was unable to use most of the inquirer.js module I had used before. It took a few hours to work out the bug.

  ## Installation
  All you need to do is clone the repository from GitHub onto your computer. Once you open the root of the new folder, you can run `npm install` in the terminal. You are now set to run the actual program.

  ## Usage
  After you have installed the npm, in the terminal type in `node index.js` and press enter. Then you will be asked a series of questions that will be used to build the README.md file. Once all questions are entered and the license is selected the program will create a README.md file.

  ## Test
  Run the index.js file in the terminal and enter the questions. If all questions are answered, then a README.md will be generated.
