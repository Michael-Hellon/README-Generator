# MOD 18 Social Network API

## Description

This project was to build a backend API for a social network application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, we will be using the native JavaScript Date object format timestamps. Node manager uses CRUD actions to get, create, update, and delete the associations between Users, Thoughts, Friends, and Reactions. 

- My motivation was to create a working social networking api that used express.js mongoose packages, as well as utilizing MongoDB and Mongoose ODM to develop the application.
- I built this project so that my client and others could utilize a social networking application where they could create, update and share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list, and allowing the user to delete their comments, reactions and friends as needed.
- This project solved the problem of creating a working social networking application that allows the users to create, update, and delete their thoughts, friends, and reactions.  
- I learned a lot from this project. I learned how to create association without a set relational structure to manage the information going into the database.

## Installation

To use this program, you will need MongoBD, or a similar NoSQL database; and Insomnia. All you need to do is clone the repository from GitHub onto your computer. Once you open the root of the new folder, you can run `npm install` in the terminal. You are now set to run the actual program.

## Usage

After you have installed the npm, in the terminal type in `npm run start`. Then you can open both MongoDB and Insomnia and start utilizing the route. First, thing you will probably have to do is create some users, and thoughts using the POST routes.  Then you can have fun creating the friends for the users, and reactions to the thoughts.
