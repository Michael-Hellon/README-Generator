# MOD-12-SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description

A SQL database that tracks employees, their roles, and their respective department. This will allow users to view, add, and change information in the database to keep employee records current.

- My motivation was to create an interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases utilizing the Command Line Interface (CLI).
- I built this project to easily view, add, and change employee information.
- This project solves the problem of allowing users to see current employee information in a table that is stored in a database.
- I learned how to create and update databases, and how to render the information in the databases to the console so that users can see the stored information.All you need to do is clone the repository from GitHub onto your computer. Once you open the root of the new folder, you can run `npm install` in the terminal. You are now set to run the actual program.
