# MOD-13-Object-Relational-Mapping-ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

This project will build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. It’s configured utilizing Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

- My motivation was to create the back end for an E-commerce site.
- I built this project so that my client could easily view their inventories by displaying the categories, products, product tags, and the tags themselves. This allows the client to see what inventory items are selling and what is not so that they can better maintain their inventories and help keep overhead costs manageable.
- This project solved the problem of maintaining proper inventory levels to compete and gain market share over other e-commerce companies.
- I learned how to utilize API endpoints, seeds, models and databases to produce a quality product for my clients.
