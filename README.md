# Professional README Generator

## Description
This project will build the user a Professional README.md file. The user will be asked several questions and will select a license from a list to use for the project.

- My motivation was to create a JavaScript program that used libraries to easily build a professional quality README.md file.
- I built this project to help save time creating a professional quality README.
- This project solved the problem of spending lots of time building and formatting a new README file for each project.
- I learned several things from doing this challenge and had lot of fun developing it. I built it in three stages with the code running properly at the end of each stage. The first stage I wrote the code all in one index.js file, like MOD 9’s mini project. Next, I split it up into its respective parts per the assignment requirements. At this stage I used an asynchronous if-else statement to initialize the app without using an inquirer function. The final stage I removed the if-else statement from the asynchronous function and replaced it with an inquirer function. I also set some defaults for the question. So, I learned how to split up the initial code I developed into separate files and how to asynchronous function to run my code.

## Installation
All you need to do is clone the repository from GitHub onto your computer. Once you open the root of the new folder, you can run `npm install` in the terminal. You are now set to run the actual program.

## Usage
After you have installed the npm, in the terminal type in `node index.js` and press enter. Then you will be asked a series of questions that will be used to build the README.md file. Once all questions are entered and the license is selected the program will create a README.md file. 

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute to this project, please see below for my contact information.
        
## Test
Run the index.js file in the terminal and enter the questions. If all questions are answered, then a README.md will be generated.
